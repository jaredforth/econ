description: Implement scoped tickets from a Donut session's lanes, verify their tests, record completion notes, and move them between lanes. Use for next-task, named-task, and whole-queue requests; not task planning.

# Swim-lane worker

Paths are relative to the project root. Tickets live in the session's lanes folder that Donut names in your assignment, `.donut/<session>/` (older projects: `swim_lanes/`); lane names below such as `to_do/` and `done/` are inside it, and other sessions' folders are not yours to touch. Follow the project's own instructions file (QWEN.md, CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md, whichever your agent reads) and the assigned ticket. Do not load planner instructions from `.claude/`, `.cursor/` or `skills/donut-planner/`.

## Pick work

- A named task or a batch-runner assignment means that task only, then stop. This overrides picking other in-progress tasks.
- “Next task” means finish one in-progress task first; otherwise pick the lowest-numbered eligible ticket from to_do/.
- “All” means recheck the queue after each ticket. Do not retry tasks blocked during this run; continue independent tasks, skipping blocked dependencies.
- Tickets have **Slug:** `name` and **Depends on:** `other-slug`, … or None. Dependencies must be in done/ before starting.
- A ticket may carry **Verify:** `command`. Donut runs that command itself after you move the ticket to done; if it fails, Donut moves the ticket to blocked/. Run it yourself first and never edit or remove the Verify line.
- Keep the complete filename unchanged. Move to_do → in_progress before editing; in_progress → done only after verification.

## Review addenda

When review is on, a reviewer model checks each ticket you move to done, in a fresh context. If it requests changes, Donut adds its feedback to the ticket body as `## Addendum N: review feedback` (a planner fixing a blocked ticket adds `## Addendum N: planner recovery` the same way), just before Completion notes, and moves the ticket back to `in_progress/`. Treat addenda as part of the ticket's requirements. On a rework, address every point in the latest addendum within the ticket's scope, rerun the tests, update Completion notes, and move the ticket to done again. Do not edit or delete addenda.

## On-hold tickets

`on_hold/` contains deliberately parked tickets. Never pick, move, or edit them, even for a named-task assignment. Report that the ticket is on hold instead. It must first be explicitly released back to `to_do/` by the user or by a planner following the user's request. A held dependency is not complete; skip dependent work. Do not move blocked work into `on_hold/` automatically: move execution failures to `blocked/`.

## Execute one ticket

1. Read the entire ticket and files it names. Run its Preflight checks before editing. Missing dependencies mean BLOCKED, not permission to rebuild them.
2. Change only files listed in its scope. Read relevant installed skills named by the task, but do not expand task scope based on a skill.
3. Run every listed test. Preserve existing unrelated work. Never weaken tests to make them pass or claim results you did not observe.
4. After three failed attempts at the same problem, or if the specification is ambiguous, stop. Move the ticket to blocked and put `BLOCKED:` with the exact reason and output in Completion notes.
5. Tick only objectively verified acceptance boxes; leave Human check boxes unticked. Record Changed, Tests (actual commands/output), Deviations, and Open issues / human checks under Completion notes.
6. Verify the changed files against the allowed scope, accounting for pre-existing changes. Move the completed ticket to done.

Never create, delete, renumber, or rewrite tickets. Only move them, tick acceptance boxes, and fill Completion notes. Do not commit, push, create branches, or install packages unless explicitly authorized by the task/user. Report extra work as open issues, not new tasks.

## Unity projects

Use installed unity-cli and unity-pipeline skills for Editor operations and the task's exact tests. Never hand-edit Unity scene/prefab YAML; use builder or Editor scripts. Do not assume a particular Unity version, rendering pipeline, physics system, input abstraction, asset style, or project path. Derive them from this project. If required Editor access is unavailable, report BLOCKED. Restore any temporary test settings you changed.

## Final summary

End with one brief table, one row per touched task (plus skipped dependencies for a whole-queue run):

| Task | Status | What changed | Tests | Human check |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Statuses: Done, Blocked, Skipped. Report actual test outcomes and outstanding human checks. In batch mode, stop after the assigned ticket; the outer runner launches the next fresh session and aggregates the run.

## Blocked tickets

`blocked/` holds tickets that cannot proceed because of failed preflight checks, missing dependencies, ambiguity, or repeated implementation failures. Record `BLOCKED:` with the reason and actual output in Completion notes, then move the ticket from `in_progress/` to `blocked/`, keeping its filename and slug. This replaces older guidance to leave blocked tickets in `in_progress/`.

Never pick or automatically retry tickets in `blocked/`, including named assignments. Their dependencies are not complete. A planner may investigate and clarify the blocker, but move the ticket back to `to_do/` only when the user explicitly requests another attempt and the blocker is addressed. Reserve blocked ticket numbers and slugs, avoid duplicate tickets, and preserve their completion notes. Keep active work that depends on blocked tickets out of the runnable queue. Workers continue independent eligible tickets.
